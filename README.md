Energia_Ethernet_Library_Included
=================================
This repository is Enegia which I added Ethernet library from Arduino onto.

Ethernet Library has no change from original version of Arduino
Just to use Ethernet Library onto Energia, some change for Energia happened.

I added some .cpp and .h, which Arduino already has, into Energia.
And I placed the whole "Ethernet" directory of Arduino in energia-0101E0009\hardware\msp430\libraries
, not energia-0101E0009\libraries.

If you download sample scatches onto MSP430 Launchpad Rev1.5 with M430G2553, then you can see it works well.

Thank you.
